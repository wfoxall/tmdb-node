# TMDb-node
A _very_ simple test using TMDb API to retrieve movie/TV ratings.

## TMDb API
The application receives its from the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) via their [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

## API Key
You'll need an API key of your own to use this application.
To obtain one you will need to create a TMDb account and request one.

Once you have an API key, you'll need to create a .env file at the root of the cloned
repo and enter the API key there. E.g:

    TMDB_APIKEY=<YOUR KEY HERE>
